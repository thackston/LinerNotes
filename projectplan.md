## üìù Notes

### üöÄ REDIS MIGRATION STRATEGY
- **Architecture Change**: From "Frontend ‚Üí Backend ‚Üí Basic MusicBrainz ‚Üí PostgreSQL" to "Frontend ‚Üí Backend ‚Üí Redis Cache ‚Üí Enhanced MusicBrainz + Smart Prioritization"
- **Key Innovation**: Original studio albums prioritized over "Greatest Hits" compilations
- **Performance Target**: >80% cache hit rate, <100ms cached responses, <2s uncached
- **Smart Caching**: 24h TTL for popular artists (Beatles, Queen), 6h for others

### üéØ MUSICBRAINZ OPTIMIZATION
- **MusicBrainz Primary Strategy**: Most comprehensive credits data (40+ relationship types)
- **Critical Rate Limit**: 1 request/second strict enforcement - must implement proper spacing
- **Commercial License Required**: Contact MetaBrainz Foundation for production pricing
- **Enhanced Integration**: Smart prioritization + intelligent caching + rate limit compliance
- **Load-on-Demand**: Implement "Load Full Credits" to avoid multiple API calls

### üí∞ COST & BUSINESS MODEL
- Phase out Discogs API due to commercial use restrictions
- Consider OneMusicAPI for premium aggregated data coverage (¬£50-1000/month)
- Focus on web-first, mobile app can come later
- Plan for API costs in business model from day 1
- Redis caching dramatically reduces API call volume and costs

---

## üö® Risk Mitigation

### üî• CRITICAL MIGRATION RISKS
- **Redis Dependency**: New single point of failure - implement fallback to direct API
- **Migration Complexity**: 9 phases, 23 tasks - high coordination risk
- **Cache Coherency**: Stale data risk - implement proper TTL and invalidation
- **Performance Regression**: New system may be slower initially - thorough testing required
- **Rollback Complexity**: Advanced system harder to rollback - feature flags essential

### ‚ö° EXISTING RISKS (STILL APPLY)
- **MusicBrainz Rate Limits**: CRITICAL - 1 req/sec enforcement with IP blocking risk
- **API Limits**: Implement aggressive caching from day 1, request queuing essential
- **Commercial Licensing**: Obtain proper licenses before scale, budget for API costs
- **Data Source Reliability**: Maintain multiple data sources, plan for API deprecation
- **Discogs Restrictions**: Commercial use requires explicit permission, plan migration
- **MusicBrainz Dependency**: Core data is free, but rate limits may constrain growth
- **Data Quality**: Show confidence scores on credits and source attribution
- **User Acquisition**: Focus on SEO and organic growth
- **Technical Debt**: Refactor every 3 sprints
- **Burnout**: Take breaks between phases

### üõ°Ô∏è MIGRATION-SPECIFIC MITIGATIONS
- **Feature Flags**: Ability to instantly switch back to old system
- **Gradual Rollout**: 50% A/B testing before full deployment
- **Monitoring**: Real-time performance and error rate monitoring
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit, integration, and performance testing
- **Documentation**: Detailed rollback procedures and troubleshooting guides
